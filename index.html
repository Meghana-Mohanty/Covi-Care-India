          <h2>What is Corona Virus?</h2>
          <p>
            Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly 
            discovered coronavirus. Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will 
            experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring 
            special treatment. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems 
            like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer 
            are more likely to develop serious illness.
          </p>

        <div class="info">
          <h2>How it Spreads</h2>
          <p>
            The virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through droplets generated
            when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or exhales. These droplets are too heavy
            to hang in the air, and quickly fall on floors or surfaces.<br>
            You can be infected by breathing in the virus if you are within close proximity
            of someone who has COVID-19, or by touching a contaminated surface and then your eyes, 
            nose or mouth.
